# harbormaster

A localhost daemon that leases each **caller** its own isolated port block — a
Firebase emulator sandbox with fresh data, a Metro port, a private simulator —
and reclaims it when the caller's process exits.

If you run several Firebase projects locally (dev, tests, CI, agents) you know the
pain: emulators fight over ports, a bare `firebase emulators:start` collides with
another suite, and `pkill` "fixes" it by nuking *everyone's* emulators. harbormaster
removes the collision entirely — two callers that both want "an impulse emulator" get
two independent suites (own ports, own data), so they never step on each other.

```
$ eval "$(harbormaster acquire --cwd ./my-app --only auth,firestore --env)"
$ echo $FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST
127.0.0.1:11001
# ...run your tests against the suite...
# it's torn down automatically when this shell exits
```

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+** — the daemon is a single Python script (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`).
  npm just ships and links the executable; it must be able to find `python3` on PATH.
- **firebase-tools** (`firebase`) on PATH — it boots the actual emulators.
- macOS or Linux.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g harbormaster        # global CLI
# or add it to a project so it ships with your app/agent:
npm install harbormaster           # → node_modules/.bin/harbormaster
```

## Usage

The daemon auto-starts on the first command. `firebase.json` ports are **optional** —
the daemon injects (and overrides) a pool block into a temp config per lease, so you
never hand-assign a port.

```bash
# Boot a private suite for the project in DIR, owned by the calling shell,
# reaped when it exits. --env prints exports to eval into your shell:
eval "$(harbormaster acquire --cwd ./my-app --only auth,firestore,functions --env)"
#   → FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST, FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST, EMULATOR_<SVC>_PORT,
#     GCLOUD_PROJECT (from .firebaserc)

# Run a command inside a fresh suite that tears down after (great for CI):
harbormaster exec --cwd ./my-app --only auth,firestore "npm test"

# Reserve a block WITHOUT booting — for a caller that starts its own suite:
harbormaster allocate --json          # → { "leaseId": "...", "base": 11000 }

# Have the DAEMON run a long-lived process (Metro, a dev server) as the lease:
# daemon-owned, so it survives the calling shell / agent session. Liveness is the
# spawned pid (+ TTL backstop); stop it with `release`. CMD sees METRO_PORT,
# DETOX_UDID/DETOX_SIM_NAME (with --sim), FBPORTS_BLOCK_BASE, FBPORTS_LEASE_ID.
eval "$(harbormaster allocate --sim --ttl 604800 \
        --spawn 'exec npx expo start --port "$METRO_PORT"' --cwd ./my-app --env)"
harbormaster release "$FBPORTS_LEASE_ID"   # tears down Metro + the sim

# Reuse gate for long-lived sessions: exit 0 iff the lease is FULLY alive
# (known to the daemon, process running, sim still present, ports up) — anything
# less means clean up your session state and re-lease:
harbormaster verify "$FBPORTS_LEASE_ID" || re_lease

harbormaster status                    # everything the daemon has out
harbormaster down --cwd ./my-app       # release this shell's lease early
```

`--json` on `acquire`/`allocate` returns the ports/base as JSON for scripting.

Version skew is self-healing: the daemon reports its version on `/health`, and a
newer client replaces an older daemon in place (leases persist in the ledger;
every leased process runs in its own session, so nothing is torn down by the
handover). A stale `node_modules` copy can no longer pin the machine to an old
daemon.

Leased simulators are part of a lease's liveness: if a sim is deleted externally
(Xcode cleanup, `simctl delete`, a device reset), the reaper notices within
`FBPORTS_SIM_CHECK_INTERVAL` (60s) and reaps the lease *whole* — killing its
spawned process too — so a half-alive session (sim gone, Metro still squatting
its port) can never linger for callers to "reuse".

## How it works

- **Caller-owned.** One primitive: `acquire {cwd, owner_pid} → {ports, projectId}`.
  Issuance is unique per *caller*, not per project — so concurrent callers of the
  same project get independent suites.
- **Reaped on exit.** The daemon kills the suite (the whole process group, so the JVM
  children die too) when `owner_pid` dies. The caller's death *is* the release —
  nothing to remember, and never a reason to `pkill`. A TTL and emulator-liveness are
  backstops.
- **Pool ports.** Blocks of 20 from 11000–14999; each firestore suite also gets a
  private websocket port, so concurrent suites never collide on the default 9150.
- **No registry, no shared instances.** A "project" is just the `firebase.json` in
  `cwd`; the project id comes from `.firebaserc`.

## The daemon's environment is nobody's test environment

The daemon is started by whichever client first needs it and would otherwise
inherit that shell. Suites it boots inherit the daemon's environment (that is
how `--fn-env` reaches the functions emulator runtime), so a variable exported
by the first caller would reach every later caller's suite for the life of the
daemon. Harbormaster therefore strips test-only and emulator-pointing variables
(`TEST_NOW_MS`, `LLM_CACHE*`, `*_EMULATOR_HOST`, `*_EMULATOR_PORT`,
`GCLOUD_PROJECT`, and the values a lease hands out) both when spawning the
daemon and when it starts serving. A suite that needs one of these gets it
explicitly: `acquire --fn-env TEST_NOW_MS=...`.

## A block docker holds is not free (0.10.0)

Free-block selection also asks `docker ps` which host ports are published. On
Linux, dockerd publishes a container's ports through iptables and, without the
userland proxy, nothing listens on them, so a connect finds the port quiet
while a container holds it. Simon Says' local Supabase stacks are containers
on harbormaster blocks. On simon-linux-1 (2026-10-09), four jobs were handed a
block a stack still held. No docker means the empty set, never a failure.
`python3 test/docker_ports.py`.

## A managed broker (0.11.0)

`harbormaster serve --managed` is for a broker that a service manager
(systemd, launchd) runs and restarts. It keeps a marker in the state dir
fresh, touched every minute. While the marker is fresh, clients never replace
the broker, even an older one, and never spawn their own. If it is briefly
down, they wait up to 2 minutes for the service manager to bring it back. Upgrades
are the service manager's job: restart it after installing a new version. A
stale marker means the service is gone, and clients spawn as before. Without
this, the broker belonged to whichever client happened to start it: on
simon-linux-1 that was a CI job, whose orphan cleanup killed the broker and
every emulator it ran for other jobs mid-suite. `python3 test/managed.py`.
